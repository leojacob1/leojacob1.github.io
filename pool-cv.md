# Pool Computer Vision

## Background

I love to play pool and I know nothing about computer vision. I figured that pool would
be a good learning application because everything is pretty specific...the table is a rectangle,
balls are circle and have specific colors and patterns. I know some python so I'm going to use
the popular OpenCV platform.

## Goal

Generate cool stats about my games such as cue ball velocity, collision angle, make %, etc in real time.
I plan to do this by mounting a camera directly above the table in my house and streaming that video feed
to my CV processor. The CV will output to a web frontend that will allow interaction with the user.

## Preliminary research

I found a few examples online of people doing similar things. The most relevant example I found was
[this paper from UCSD](http://kastner.ucsd.edu/ryan/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/03/admin/pool-aid.pdf) (Go Tritons!).

I also found this [less-detailed but still useful blog](https://gocardless.com/blog/hacking-on-side-projects-the-pool-ball-tracker/) from a London startup.
