#Pool Computer Vision

##Background

I love to play pool and I know nothing about computer vision. I figured that pool would
be a good learning application because everything is pretty specific...the table is a rectangle,
balls are circle and have specific colors and patterns. I know some python so I'm going to use
the popular OpenCV platform
