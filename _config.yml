  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I'm a high school student at the Branson School in Marin County, CA.  I love coding and statistics. I do 
    my web and mobile devlopment with Node.js and React, and I do my statistical analysis with R. I post my 
    projects on this site, so please check them out and reach out to me with questions, feedback, or to share 
    something related that you've done.  I'm always looking for cool people, projects, and opportunities! </p>
