# Kawhi T-Shirt Reselling

**Background:** I was in Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia, with a few minutes to kill, and I came across a New Balance store. I went in (with zero intention to buy anything) and saw that they were selling shirts with Kawhi slogans on them.

I absolutely love Kawhi as a player, despite the protest from the most bitter aspects of my Sixers fandom.
